## About me

Omar Boufous received a M.Eng (Distinction) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Institut Mines Telecom. He was an Exchange Student at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Sciences, University College London. He later completed a double M.Sc jointly from Aalto University (Helsinki, Finland) and KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden) specializing in Intelligent Autonomous Systems. He worked as an intern on research-related topics namely at Safran and Astek Research & Innovation Lab.

He is currently a Doctoral Researcher in Game Theory and Machine Learning in the Modelling and Statistical Analysis team at Orange Labs Network, which is part of the research and development division of the Orange group. My academic supervisors are [Rachid El-Azouzi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Tvto5qkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Eitan Altman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pEfJPS0AAAAJ&hl=en).

The Modelling and Statistical Analysis team is composed of researchers with different backgrounds, mostly in Machine Learning and Telecommunication Networks, working in synergy to develop new methods and tools for analyzing decision-taking processes using mathematics, computer science & AI. 

## The PhD

Game theory is the umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers. The main motivation of the PhD is to develop distributed learning methods that guarantee convergence to correlated equilibria, which is a core solution concept in Game Theory, along with Nash equilibria. 
This stives to dervie learning rules and conditions on how players can reach the equilibrium. To this end, the framework of repeated one-shot games is  considered in which players are allowed to revise their strategy over time in response to available information regarding previous plays of the game.

Correlated equilibira were first introduced by Aumann in 1974, and unlike Nash equilibria, they are computationally less expensive - computing a correlated equilibrium only requires solving a linear program. The set of correlated equilibria often characterizes more efficient and optimal collective behavior than the Nash equilibrium solution concept.
These notions apply to a wide range of situations, and have applications in all fields of social science, as well as in network systems and computer science. 


## Research interests

His main interests are game theory, distributed optimization, machine learning and telecommunication networks. His work is interdisciplinary, and includes theoretical concepts from control theory, multi-agent systems and optimization applied to various engineering problems.


## Double Degree

Omar Boufous pursued the double Master of Science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Aalto University as part of the EIT (European Institute of Technology) Digital Master School. The double degree combines strong technical programmes with business-oriented modules (Innovation and Entrepreneurship courses, Summer Schools and Business Development Labs, etc).
