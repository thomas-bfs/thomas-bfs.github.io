## Outreach

I was invited by the School of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Turin, Italy) to take part in the Inventor Experience which is a 10-day Bootcamp encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship for engineering students in Europe. The event was broadcasted live on facebook. The video can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/199732320574181/videos/380805112866572/?__so__=channel_tab&__rv__=all_videos_card).
